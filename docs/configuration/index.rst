Configuration
=============

AerisCloud comes with several features that are available only through the
``config`` command in ``aeris`` (see also :ref:`aeris-config`). The
configuration file can be found in the config folder of your operating system
(``~/.config/AerisCloud`` for Linux and ``~/Library/Application Support/AerisCloud``
for OSX) under the name ``config.ini``.
