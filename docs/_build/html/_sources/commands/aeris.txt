Aeris Command
=============

The ``aeris`` command is the main command you will use during development as
it deals with the local environment and boxes. It is a wrapper around the
``vagrant`` and ``ansible`` commands that takes care for you of most of the
cruft around those tools and bind them in a coherent package.

While the tool sports a large amount of commands, you will deal mainly with
a small subset of them.
