AerisCloud
==========

AerisCloud is a tool that gives application developers development environments
that are identical to the production servers, and gives system administrators a
way to organize their infrastructure as it is growing in size.

To accomplish this goal it extends 2 popular tools: ``vagrant`` and ``ansible``;
and offers a simple to use unified command line interface to manage their projects.
